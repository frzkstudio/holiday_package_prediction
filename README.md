# Holiday Package Prediction - Machine Learning Classification

## Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning classification project for predicting holiday package bookings. The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can predict whether a customer is likely to purchase a holiday package based on various features and historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and is titled "Holiday Package Prediction." It contains information about customers, their demographics, travel history, and whether they booked a holiday package or not.

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/susant4learning/holiday-package-purchase-prediction/data).

## Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the dataset and relationships between variables.
3. Model Building: Developing machine learning classification models.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of models and selecting the best one.
5. Deployment: Making predictions and using the model for new data.

## Results

The results of the machine learning classification, including model performance metrics and insights, are available in the [Results](/presentation.pdf) directory. These insights provide an overview of the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## How to Use

If you want to reproduce or build upon this classification project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset from the Kaggle link provided above and place it in the irectory.
3. Review the Jupyter Notebook ([Analysis.ipynb](/source_code_customers_prediction.ipynb)) for the complete code and detailed analysis.
4. Explore the [Results](/presentation.pdf) directory for model evaluation and key findings.
